**Crush-A-Berry: Garden Jam!** in this game you'll be harvesting ripe berries, avoid rotten ones, and racing against the clock to fill your jam jar in time for a picnic. Sweet, cozy, and just a little chaotic! I like whack-a-mole as much as the next person, especially when I want to let out some healthy frustration... but maybe I feel bad for the moles! So, I made this game to crush some berries and make jam instead.

## 🎮 Getting Started & How to Play

[Crush-A-Berry: Garden Jam!](https://f-bossom.github.io/Crush-A-Berry-Garden-Jam/)

- Click **ripe berries** 🫐🍇🍓🍒 to turn them into jam
- Watch out for **growing berries** — they’re not ready to be made into jam yet!
- **Rotten berries** will fall off the bushes automatically and _reduce_ your total amount of jam (guess you spilled some jam while cleaning up rotten berries)
- Fill the jam jar before the timer runs out to win!

## ⏱️ Game Rules

- You start with **60 seconds**
- The jam bar fills as you collect ripe berries
- Avoid clicking the 🐛 or they will eat some of your berries... And you have to swipe this pest away before continuing to gather! Costing you time and jam! (your game timer will lose 5 seconds & your mouse is click-locked 3 seconds)
- Click the 🐇 to gain more time! They are so happy you chose to pet them, amidst the berry collecting, that you gain more game time! (your game timer will gain 5 seconds)
